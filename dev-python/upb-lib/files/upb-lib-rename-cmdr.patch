 ## Overview
 
-Simplest thing right now is when in the root of the git repo that you have cloned is to enter the command `bin/simple`. This program requires that the environment variable `UPBPIM_URL` set to indicate how to connect to the PIM. For example, `serial:///dev/cu.KeySerial1` connects to the PIM on a serial port (`serial://`) `/dev/cu/KeySerial1`. On Windows something like `serial://COM1` might work.

-Read the code in `bin/simple`. That is the short use of the API around. Beyond that look at the file `lights.py` and `links.py`. Any method in those files that has a description that starts with `(Helper)` are generally UPB actions.

 UPB Links are named as a concatenation of the UPB network ID and the link number. For example, link number 6 on UPB network 142 would be `"142_6"`.

 ### Transition Rate
 Many UPB commands take a `rate`. This API supports the rate as a number of seconds, which is different than what the protocol uses. The protocol allows a set of distinct rates, listed below. For example in the UPB protocol if the rate 7 is sent to a device then the fade rate (for example) would be 20 seconds.
